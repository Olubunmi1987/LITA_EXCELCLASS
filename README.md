## DATA STRUCTURE:This can be structure Dataset, Semi-structure Dataset and Unstructured data set.
#### STRUCTURE DATASET: Means the data is in table formate and is ready to be use for analysis
#### SEMI-STRUCTURE DATASET: Means the data is in Javascript form with pairs
#### UNSTRUCTURE DATASET: Means the data needs to undergone restructuring to make it ready to be use for analysis. This can be done by a process called for example
ETL; EXtract, Transform and Load
-  Extract data means connecting to the data source so as to pull out data
- Transform data means removing or adding to your data to make it to be in a form ready for analysis.
- Load data. means to input a ready data into any tool for analysis.

    2.  transformation
    3.  validation
    4.  visualisation
